FIX: Email registration with verification email

CURRENT ISSUE:
After user submits registration form, getting 401 errors because the app tries to access protected resources before email is verified.

CORRECT EMAIL REGISTRATION FLOW:

Step 1 - User Registration:
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email,
  password,
  options: {
    emailRedirectTo: `${window.location.origin}/auth/callback`
  }
})

if (error) {
  toast.error(error.message)
  return
}

// Supabase AUTOMATICALLY sends verification email via Resend
// Email will come from: noreply@desk-mate.it
// User will receive link to verify their email
```

Step 2 - Show Success Message:
After successful signup, DON'T redirect to onboarding.
Instead, show clear message to user:
```typescript
// Show this UI after signup:
<div className="text-center">
  <h2>Check your email</h2>
  <p>We've sent a verification link to {email}</p>
  <p>Click the link in the email to verify your account, then return here to login.</p>
  <Button onClick={() => router.push('/login')}>Go to Login</Button>
</div>
```

Step 3 - Email Verification:
- User checks email inbox (from noreply@desk-mate.it)
- User clicks verification link in email
- Supabase verifies email automatically
- User is redirected back to app via /auth/callback

Step 4 - User Returns and Logs In:
- User goes to /login page
- User enters email + password
- After successful login → redirect to /onboarding

CRITICAL POINTS:
1. ✅ signUp() automatically triggers verification email (already configured via Resend)
2. ❌ DON'T auto-login after signup
3. ❌ DON'T redirect to onboarding before email verification
4. ✅ Show clear "Check your email" message
5. ✅ Provide link to go to login page
6. ✅ Only after verified email + successful login → onboarding

SUPABASE CONFIG:
Email sending is already configured:
- SMTP: Resend (smtp.resend.com)
- Sender: noreply@desk-mate.it
- Verification emails are sent automatically

Make sure the registration page shows the "Check your email" state and doesn't try to access profiles or user_settings until after login.
